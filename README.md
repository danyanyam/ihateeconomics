# Hello, there!

My name is Danya and my major is economics, but i like programming so muuuuch, therefore i decided to learn more about something particularly more interesting: neural networks. In this directory i will publish my projects in order to watch my progress and keep developing myself in this sphere.

My completed projects:

- [UCI heart decease problem, kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) 88.2% keras
- [HSE Bulletin Board parser](https://www.hse.ru/ba/economics/students/)
- [VK chat-bot](https://github.com/danyanyam/ihateeconomics/tree/master/VK%20group%20chat%20bot) bot works only if my computer is turned on, so you have no chance to try it on your own, but maybe you are lucky enough to see bot working in this [group](https://vk.com/public97121274).
