# Hello, there!

My name is Danya and my major is economics, but i don't think i like it, therefore i decided to learn more about something particularly more interesting: neural networks. In this directory i will publish my projects in order to watch my progress and keep developing myself in this sphere.

My completed projects:

- [UCI heart decease problem, kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) 88.2% keras
- [HSE Bulletin Board parser](https://www.hse.ru/ba/economics/students/)
